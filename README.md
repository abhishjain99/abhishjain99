## üî≠ WORK EXPERIENCE
### Software Engineer, Elasticrun, Pune | July 2020 - June 2022
- Developed different platforms using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Python for Data Science solutions with the Data Science Team.
- <b>Reduced planning time from 15 days to 3 days</b> by engineering a Sales and Operations Planning tool for field managers using Python, RestAPI, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
- Pioneered the development of a brand platform, using Javascript, Python and MySQL <b>optimizing the time to generate insights from 2 days to 2 minutes</b> for metrics such as sales, throughput, customer engagement, and reach of partner brands.
- Created a brand platform which became a one-stop solution for partner brands to get insights of metrics like sales, throughput, customers, reach, etc. through dashboards and used Google Analytics to capture usage patterns. It <b>reduced the 2 day work to 2 minute dashboard</b>.
- Designed insightful UI for Data Science and Forecast Analysis team to monitor machine learning models and predict warehouse sales.
- Analyzed customer acquisition using HotJar and Google Analytics to improve user-friendliness and engagement.
- Built a one-stop solution to visualize the sales data for warehouses based on 32 different dimensions using the D3JS library.
-¬†Performed on all levels of the software engineering cycle from documentation to testing, maintenance, and support of all the platforms I built which allowed me to develop the ability to work efficiently and effectively as part of a team.
